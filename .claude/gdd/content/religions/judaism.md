## Identity

- Historical period: One of the oldest monotheistic religions, with origins in the Bronze Age Levant (c. 2000–1200 BCE); the diaspora community spread Judaism across the Mediterranean, Persia, and eventually globally during the Exploration Age equivalent.
- Flavor: Judaism is one of the pre-defined historical religion options available as a cosmetic selection at religion founding. Its icon (Star of David) is included in the vanilla Civ VII religion icon set. Judaism historically spread through diaspora communities rather than active missionary campaigns, making the Civ VII missionary mechanic somewhat ahistorical for this religion.
- **Key design note:** In Civ VII, the religion name and icon chosen at founding are purely cosmetic. All gameplay mechanics derive from the Reliquary, Founder, and Enhancer Beliefs selected — not from the religion name itself.

## Stats / numeric attributes

- Effect: Cosmetic only — no unique gameplay effect tied to the name "Judaism." All effects come from chosen beliefs.
- Unlock condition: Found during Exploration Age by researching the Piety Civic and constructing a Temple (first Temple for the player).
- Stacking: One religion per player; cosmetic name is chosen once and locked.

### Design notes on historical fit

Unlike Christianity, Islam, or Buddhism, Judaism has historically been a non-missionary faith that spread primarily through diaspora migration rather than active proselytization. Civ VII's missionary mechanic represents an intentional abstraction — the game models all religions through a single spread mechanism regardless of historical accuracy. This is consistent with every prior Civ game.

The `Reliquaries` belief (+1 Relic per conversion of settlements with a Temple or Altar) has the strongest thematic resonance, alluding to the Temple traditions in Judaism.

## Notes / uncertainty

Judaism has the least historical fit with the missionary mechanic of any vanilla religion in Civ VII — active proselytization was not a feature of Jewish practice. The game treats this as an acceptable abstraction. The `Desert Faith` founder belief and `Reliquaries` reliquary belief have the strongest thematic connections to Judaic tradition.
