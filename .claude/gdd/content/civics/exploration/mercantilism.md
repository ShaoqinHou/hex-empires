## Stats / numeric attributes

Researching unlocks the items listed above. Mastery research provides additional reward (cost ~80% of base civic cost per systems/civic-tree.md; source conflict flagged there).

```yaml
effects:
  - type: UNLOCK
    items: "Trade Winds policy, Tomb of Askia"

```

## Notes / uncertainty

- Culture costs from Fextralife cross-referenced with community tables
- Mastery effects partially sourced; some `[INFERRED]` where source ambiguous
- Civ-unique civics only researchable by the associated civ

## Mapping to hex-empires

_Populated during implementation, not GDD authoring._
