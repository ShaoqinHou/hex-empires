## Notes / uncertainty

- Exact numeric values `[INFERRED]` in some cases where Fandom source returned 403
- Distant Lands exclusivity per `systems/resources.md`; the 5 confirmed Distant-exclusives are spices, sugar, cocoa, tea + 1 unnamed
- Terrain spawn rules partially `[INFERRED]` from series convention; not all resources have published spawn terrain
