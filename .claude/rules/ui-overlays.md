# HUD / Overlay Rules

## The Rule

HUD and overlay elements in `packages/web/src/` — tooltips, notifications, toasts, validation feedback, hover previews, turn transitions, minimap, hint badges — are managed by a single React context (`HUDManager`, planned), wrapped in a shared chrome component (`TooltipShell`, planned) when the element is tooltip-shaped, styled exclusively from tokens in `packages/web/src/styles/hud-tokens.css` (planned) plus the existing `panel-tokens.css`, and positioned through a shared strategy — never via ad-hoc `position: absolute` with magic-number offsets.

Panels (explicit player-triggered surfaces that block panel-level interaction) are governed by `.claude/rules/panels.md`. This document governs everything else — the transient, cursor-driven, engine-driven overlays that float over the map.

**Implementation status:** the foundation (`HUDManager`, `TooltipShell`, `hud-tokens.css`) does not yet exist in the tree. The HUD UI audit (`.claude/workflow/design/hud-ui-audit.md`) catalogues the current ad-hoc overlays and their drift. This rule doc defines the target pattern that audit implementation will land on, and that all new HUD work should anticipate. Where the rule refers to `HUDManager` or `TooltipShell` as existing APIs, read it as "the target shape" until the audit migration lands. New overlays written today should already use CSS tokens, already avoid magic positioning, and already keep visibility concerns out of local component state — so migration later is mechanical.

These rules exist because, in parallel with the panel manager audit (M31 → M33), the HUD layer has accumulated the same class of drift: three tooltip positioning strategies, two duplicate-content bugs (M37-B regression test still in place), validation feedback that steals focus from the canvas, minimap components re-implementing `user-select: none` locally, and at least four overlays with hard-coded pixel offsets that clip at small viewports. The HUD audit quantifies the exact list.

## What Counts as a HUD / Overlay

An overlay is any non-panel UI that appears or disappears based on game state, cursor movement, or engine events — anything absolutely positioned, transient, or responsive to canvas events rather than menu buttons.

Include:

- **Hover tooltips** — tile info, unit info, combat preview, building placement preview, adjacency hint bubbles.
- **Notifications / toasts** — save-complete messages, age-progress ticks, tech-unlocked toasts.
- **Validation feedback** — "can't do that here", "not enough gold", "requires researching X first".
- **Turn transitions** — the brief interstitial between player turns.
- **Minimap** — the map-overview viewport frame.
- **Hint badges** — urban placement scores, adjacency previews, best-tile highlights.
- **Enemy activity summary** — post-AI-turn surfaces.

Do NOT include (these are panels, governed by `.claude/rules/panels.md`):

- Anything triggered by a TopBar button or keyboard shortcut that opens a dashboard.
- Anything with a title bar and close button.
- Anything that blocks the player until resolved (age transition, crisis, victory).

**Rule of thumb:** if it has a `<PanelShell>`, it's a panel. If it's floating text attached to a cursor, a tile, or a fixed screen corner, it's an overlay.

## HUDManager Context (planned)

**Location (planned):** `packages/web/src/ui/hud/HUDManager.tsx`

A single React context that owns HUD-level state and coordinated dismiss. Provider is mounted once near the top of the React tree, same nesting level as `PanelManagerProvider`.

### Target API

```typescript
interface HUDManagerValue {
  // Registration — overlays announce themselves when mounted so the manager
  // can coordinate dismiss, focus, and stack-cycle.
  readonly register:   (id: HUDElementId, entry: HUDEntry) => () => void;   // returns unregister
  readonly dismiss:    (id: HUDElementId) => void;
  readonly dismissAll: () => void;

  // Stack-cycle — for hover targets holding multiple entities (e.g. two units
  // + a district on one hex), the manager tracks which is being shown.
  readonly cycleIndex:      (anchorKey: string) => number;
  readonly advanceCycle:    (anchorKey: string) => void;
  readonly resetCycle:      (anchorKey: string) => void;

  // Query — other HUD elements occasionally need to know "is the tile
  // tooltip currently visible at this anchor?" (e.g. to suppress a redundant
  // hint badge).
  readonly isActive: (id: HUDElementId) => boolean;
}

const { register, dismiss, cycleIndex, advanceCycle } = useHUDManager();
```

`useHUDManager` throws if called outside `HUDManagerProvider` — same pattern as `useGame` / `usePanelManager`. Silent no-ops hide mis-wirings.

### ESC handling

ESC is delegated to the provider. It runs in **capture phase**, after `PanelManagerProvider`'s ESC handler in the registration order. Precedence:

1. If a panel is open → panel manager handles ESC and stops propagation. HUD manager never sees it.
2. If no panel is open but a sticky overlay (`sticky: true`) is visible → HUD manager dismisses that overlay and stops propagation.
3. If no panel and no sticky overlay but a stack-cycle is active → HUD manager resets the cycle index for the currently-hovered anchor.
4. Otherwise → falls through to the canvas' ESC-deselect handler.

Per-overlay ESC handlers are forbidden. One handler at the manager level, period.

### What the provider does NOT do

- Render any overlay components. Overlays are rendered by App.tsx (or the existing `GameUI`) and by canvas-adjacent components based on engine state and cursor events.
- Hold cursor position or map-hover state. That lives in canvas hooks (`useHexHover`, etc.). The manager only receives the hover target identity when an overlay decides to register.
- Decide positioning. `TooltipShell` owns that (see below).

---

## TooltipShell Component (planned)

**Location (planned):** `packages/web/src/ui/hud/TooltipShell.tsx`

Shared chrome for tooltip-shaped overlays. Not every HUD element uses it — toasts and the minimap have their own shell patterns — but every hover tooltip, combat preview, placement hint, and validation bubble does.

### Target props

```typescript
interface TooltipShellProps {
  readonly id: HUDElementId;
  readonly anchor: HexCoord | ScreenCoord;      // what the shell orbits
  readonly position: 'floating' | 'fixed-corner' | 'side';
  readonly tier: 'compact' | 'detailed';        // responds to Alt-held state
  readonly sticky?: boolean;                    // if true, does not dismiss on pointer-leave
  readonly offset?: 'auto' | 'small' | 'large'; // 'auto' picks by tile-occlusion math
  readonly children: ReactNode;
}
```

### Position strategies

| Strategy | When to use | Behavior |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `floating` | Follows the cursor / anchor; used for quick-read tooltips. | Positioned relative to anchor, auto-offset to avoid occluding the hovered tile. Clamped to viewport. |
| `fixed-corner` | Detailed info panel that would occlude the anchor if floating (combat preview in detailed tier, multi-entity tile info). | Snaps to a fixed screen corner (default bottom-right, configurable). No arrow / connector; the anchor gets a highlight outline instead. |
| `side` | Secondary content that should stay visible while the cursor moves on the map (placement hint with adjacency preview). | Anchored to one side of the viewport, persistent while the parent interaction is active. |

The shell chooses the corner (`fixed-corner`) based on cursor quadrant; it chooses the offset (`floating`) based on the anchor's projected screen rect vs. viewport edge.

### What the shell handles for you

- Translating `anchor` (`HexCoord` or `ScreenCoord`) to a clamped screen position.
- Applying `user-select: none` and suppressing the browser context menu on the shell surface (canvas right-click for gameplay is unaffected — the shell is transparent to events outside its bounds).
- Setting `aria-hidden={tier === 'compact'}` so screen readers pick up the detailed tier but not the per-tile flicker.
- Exposing `data-hud-id={id}`, `data-hud-position={position}`, `data-hud-tier={tier}` — used by Playwright specs and visual-regression snapshots.
- Applying tokens for bg, border, padding, radius.
- Pointer-events discipline: `floating` shells are `pointer-events: none` so they do not interrupt tile hover; `fixed-corner` and `sticky` shells allow pointer events so their content can be interactive.

### What the shell does NOT do

- Decide **whether** to mount. The caller does the conditional render.
- Own the tier. `tier` is a prop driven by the Alt-held state (a hook reads the keyboard; every tooltip consumer passes the same value).
- Style the body. Children render freely inside the shell's body slot.
- Duplicate content when multiple entities are on one hex. That's a caller concern — the caller consumes `cycleIndex` from `HUDManager` and renders one entity at a time with a "1 / 3 — Tab to cycle" indicator.

### Example usage

```tsx
import { TooltipShell } from '../hud/TooltipShell';
import { useHUDManager } from '../hud/HUDManager';

export function TileTooltip({ anchor, tile }: TileTooltipProps) {
  const { cycleIndex, advanceCycle } = useHUDManager();
  const stacked = tile.units;
  const i = cycleIndex(coordToKey(anchor));
  const shownUnit = stacked[i % stacked.length];

  return (
    <TooltipShell
      id="tileTooltip"
      anchor={anchor}
      position="floating"
      tier="compact"
    >
      <div style={{ color: 'var(--panel-text-color)', fontSize: '13px' }}>
        {tile.terrain.name}
        {stacked.length > 1 && (
          <span style={{ color: 'var(--panel-muted-color)', marginLeft: 'var(--panel-padding-sm)' }}>
            ({i + 1} / {stacked.length} — Tab to cycle)
          </span>
        )}
      </div>
      {shownUnit && <UnitLine unit={shownUnit} />}
    </TooltipShell>
  );
}
```

## Positioning Rules

Positioning is the #1 drift vector. These are non-negotiable:

1. **No ad-hoc `absolute` positioning with magic numbers.** Every overlay goes through `TooltipShell` (tooltip-shaped) or one of the named shells that will land in `packages/web/src/ui/hud/` for toasts/minimap/turn-transition. Inline `style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 16, right: 24 }}` is forbidden.
2. **Overlays must not cover their anchor.** For a hovered tile, the overlay either offsets far enough to keep the tile visible, or switches to `fixed-corner`. The threshold is ~30% visible-tile occlusion; `TooltipShell` computes this and auto-switches when needed.
3. **Stack-cycle support.** When the anchor has multiple entities (two units on a hex, a unit + a district), the overlay must indicate cycle-ability (`Tab to cycle`, or on-click arrows) and render through `HUDManager.cycleIndex`. Never silently show only one entity; never duplicate-render (regression test in `packages/web/src/__tests__/playwright/tooltip.spec.ts` guards the duplicate-content bug fixed in M37-B).
4. **Clamp to viewport.** Every shell clamps its final position into viewport bounds minus a small margin. No overlay may be partially or fully off-screen.
5. **Stable layout on Alt toggle.** When the tier changes from `compact` to `detailed`, the overlay's anchor stays fixed — only the body grows. The shell handles re-clamping without flicker.

## Game-Feel Invariants

Overlays inherit the panel layer's game-feel rules and add their own:

- **No browser text selection on the game surface.** `user-select: none` is set globally on `.game-app` by the panel layer's CSS. Overlays must not re-enable it (no `user-select: text` overrides).
- **No default right-click context menu** in canvas or overlay regions. The canvas suppresses it for gameplay right-click; overlays suppress it via `TooltipShell`.
- **ESC dismisses transient overlays** OR resets the stack-cycle index — routed through `HUDManager`.
- **Overlays never steal keyboard focus.** Hover tooltips, toasts, and validation feedback are non-interactive; `fixed-corner` detailed tooltips may be interactive but must use `tabindex="-1"` on the container to stay out of the tab order. The player's tab order is: TopBar buttons → BottomBar buttons → panel content (when open).
- **No autoscroll or viewport jumps.** When an overlay appears, the canvas camera stays put. No `scrollIntoView` calls in overlay code.
- **Cursor stays unchanged** unless the overlay is explicitly announcing a drag-select or hot-zone. Tooltips don't change the cursor.

---

## Styling

The rule mirrors panels: **tokens only, never raw hex**.

- **Chrome-adjacent surfaces** (shell bg, border, divider, typography base) → `var(--panel-*)` tokens from `panel-tokens.css` so HUD chrome matches panel chrome; the two systems share the dark-slate aesthetic.
- **HUD-specific values** (tooltip arrow color, toast fade timing, validation-red accent, stack-cycle indicator pill) → `var(--hud-*)` tokens from `hud-tokens.css` (planned). When the audit lands, it will populate this file; until then, reuse panel tokens and avoid hard-coded values.
- **Game-data display** (faction colors in a player-activity toast, yield icons in a combat preview) → existing global tokens in `packages/web/src/index.css` (`--color-gold`, `--color-surface`), same as panels.
- **Never raw hex.** Not in inline styles, not in className utilities (`bg-red-500/20`), not in lookup tables. The panel audit logged six violations; the HUD audit already has three tracked (validation feedback's red, toast success green, turn-transition overlay opacity).

```tsx
// GOOD
<div style={{
  backgroundColor: 'var(--panel-bg)',
  border: '1px solid var(--panel-border)',
  padding: 'var(--panel-padding-sm) var(--panel-padding-md)',
  borderRadius: 'var(--panel-radius)',
  color: 'var(--panel-text-color)',
}}>
  Not enough gold.
</div>

// BAD
<div style={{ background: '#1f2937', border: '1px solid #dc2626', padding: 8 }}>
  Not enough gold.
</div>
<div className="bg-red-500/20 border-red-500 px-2 py-1">Not enough gold.</div>
```

If a value is genuinely new (e.g. a HUD-specific timing or accent), add it to `hud-tokens.css` first, then reference the variable. The rule is add-a-token, not add-a-literal.

## Information Hierarchy (for hover tooltips)

The tile tooltip is the most-read HUD element in the game. Its information density must be deliberate:

### Compact tier (default, always-on)

- Terrain name (Grassland, Forest, Mountain …)
- Feature (River, Woods, Marsh) inline with terrain
- Improvement if present (Farm, Mine, …)
- Resource if visible to the active player
- **Summed yields** (Food 2, Production 3, Gold 1 — one number per yield type)
- **Top entity only** on stacked hexes, with an "(1 / N — Tab to cycle)" indicator

### Detailed tier (Alt-held)

- Yield breakdown by source (Grassland +1, Farm +1, Adjacency +1)
- Full stats for the currently-cycled unit (hp, xp, promotions, movement)
- Building details (effect, maintenance, adjacencies) if anchor is a city tile
- Adjacency preview for districts (which neighbors contribute which yield)

Do not put detailed-tier info into the compact tier "to be helpful". The compact tier is optimised for glance-reading at 4-second hover cadence. The detailed tier is optimised for deliberate reading. Respect that split.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | Do this instead |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| `<div style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 24, right: 16 }}>` inline on a component | Three positioning strategies in the codebase; each adjusts magic numbers independently; clips at small viewports. | Wrap in `TooltipShell` with an explicit `position` prop. |
| Raw hex or Tailwind color utilities in overlay chrome (`bg-slate-900`, `'#dc2626'`) | Drifts from the dark-slate aesthetic; blocks future theming; violates `tech-conventions.md`. | `var(--panel-*)` or `var(--hud-*)` tokens. |
| Rendering all stacked entities simultaneously, stacked visually | Occludes the tile; defeats the stacking-is-intentional design; was the M37-B duplicate-content bug. | One entity at a time via `HUDManager.cycleIndex`; "(i / N — Tab to cycle)" indicator. |
| `useEffect(() => addEventListener('keydown', escClose))` per overlay | Fights the `HUDManager` ESC handler; capture-vs-bubble order matters; produces "ESC does nothing" bugs. | `HUDManager` owns ESC in capture phase after `PanelManager`. |
| `tabIndex={0}` on a hover tooltip | Steals keyboard focus; breaks the TopBar → panel tab order; screen readers read stale content. | Tooltips are non-interactive; use `tabindex="-1"` only when the shell is `fixed-corner` and sticky. |
| `style={{ width: 420 }}` fixed pixel width on the shell | Clips at narrow viewports; ignores the tier switch (compact should be narrower than detailed). | Let `TooltipShell` size itself via `width: 'narrow' \| 'wide' \| 'full'` tokens (matches panel width vocabulary). |
| Re-implementing `user-select: none` or `onContextMenu={e => e.preventDefault()}` on every overlay | Four overlays do this locally today; one forgets it and the shell's game-feel breaks on that surface. | The shell applies both. Remove the local overrides as overlays migrate. |
| Hold overlay visibility in `useState<boolean>` and toggle from three places | Two sources of truth for "is the combat preview visible"; dismissed one way does not clear the other. | `HUDManager.register` with an engine-derived predicate; dismiss via `HUDManager.dismiss` only. |
| A tooltip that scrolls the canvas into view | Camera drift on hover is disorienting. | Overlays are read-only over whatever the player is already looking at; camera control is the player's. |

---

## Testing

### Body tests (per overlay)

Smoke tests live next to the overlay:

```
packages/web/src/ui/hud/__tests__/<OverlayName>.test.tsx
```

Wrap in a test `HUDManagerProvider` (once built) with an `initialCycleIndex` or mocked register, so the overlay renders in isolation. Verify:

- The body renders the expected content for a known state.
- The correct tier shows the correct fields (compact vs detailed).
- Stack-cycle is respected (given cycleIndex=1, entity #2 renders, not #1).

Do **not** re-test `TooltipShell` chrome. Do **not** re-test `HUDManager` ESC. Those have their own test files.

### Shell tests (once)

`TooltipShell` chrome behavior — position clamping, tier switching, cycle indicator, pointer-events discipline — is tested once in `packages/web/src/ui/hud/__tests__/TooltipShell.test.tsx`. `HUDManager` state — register/dismiss, cycle index, ESC precedence — is tested once in `HUDManager.test.tsx`.

### Cross-cutting invariants (Playwright)

The HUD has a small set of game-feel invariants that only an E2E can confirm. Covered in `packages/web/src/__tests__/playwright/hud.spec.ts`:

- Zero `pageerror` on hover over any tile in a freshly-started game.
- Tile tooltip text appears within 200ms of hover (via `.toContainText`).
- Duplicate-content regression: given two units + a city on one hex, exactly one unit name appears in the tooltip body at any time (guards the M37-B fix).
- ESC with a sticky tooltip visible dismisses the tooltip, not the canvas selection.
- `user-select` computed style on `.game-app` is `none`.
